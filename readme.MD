# Troubleshot
### How to solve react hooks problem in apps
add this in `webpack.config` main app
```
resolve: {
  react: path.resolve('../../node_modules/react'),
  'react-router-dom': path.resolve('../../node_modules/react-router-dom')
}
```

for avoid `onlyText` lang issues, use these functions inside components tree. Do NOT create constants that use these functions outside components.... use `useMemo` for this
