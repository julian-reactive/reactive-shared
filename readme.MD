# Reactive Shared
Super Set of libraries for build Apps faster.

This app will help to build list/form based app faster without too much thinking.

The main libraries in this app are:
- [react](https://es.reactjs.org/)
- [mui](https://mui.com/)
- [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/)
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

Other libraries like [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup), [moment](https://momentjs.com/), [lodash](https://lodash.com/), etc. are used as helper for main libraries. Further it's described how are used.

# IMPORTANT!
__Reactive Shared__ was build with __webpack__  as bundler and some ___peerDependencies___. It's ___mandatory___ to keep same versions in main app, for avoid conflicts and duplicated libraries. 
- "@date-io/date-fns": "^2.14.0",
- "@emotion/react": "11.9.3",
- "@emotion/styled": "11.9.3",
- "@fontsource/roboto": "4.5.7",
- "@mui/icons-material": "5.8.4",
- "@mui/material": "5.9.0",
- "@mui/system": "^5.9.0",
- "@mui/x-date-pickers": "^5.0.0-beta.2",
- "date-fns": "^2.28.0",
- "lodash": "4.17.21",
- "moment": "^2.29.3",
- "moment-timezone": "^0.5.34",
- "react": "18.2.0",
- "react-router-dom": "6.3.0",
- "yup": "^0.32.11"

For use them correctly it's needed to add some of them as alias in ___webpack.config___ file. Ie `webpack.common.js`:
```
...
resolve: {
  ...
  '@mui': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/@mui'),
  lodash: path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/lodash'),
  react: path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/react'),
  'react-router-dom': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/react-router-dom'),
  '@date-io/date-fns': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/@date-io/date-fns'),
  'date-fns': path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/date-fns'),
  ...
  },
  ...
}
```

# Troubleshot
- for avoid `onlyText` lang issues, use these functions inside components tree. Do not create constants that use these functions outside components.... use `useMemo` for this.
